                    <p class="p">Before 1949, computers could execute commands, but they could not remember what they did as they were not able to store these commands. In 1950, Alan Turing discussed how to build         intelligent machines and test this intelligence in his paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”. Five years later, the first AI programme was presented at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence (DSPRAI). This event was the catalyst for AI research for the next few decades.</p>
                    <p class="p">AI was revived in the 1980s with the expansion of the algorithmic toolkit and more dedicated funds. John Hopefield and David Rumelhart introduced “deep learning” techniques that allowed computers to learn through experience. Edward Feigenbaum introduced “expert systems” that mimicked human decision-making. Despite a lack of government funding and public hype, AI thrived and many landmark goals were achieved in the next two decades. In 1997, reigning chess World Champion and Grandmaster Gary Kasparov was defeated by IBM’s Deep Blue, a chess-playing computer program. In the same year, speech recognition software developed by Dragon Systems was implemented on Windows. Cynthia Breazeal also developed Kismet, a robot who could recognise and display emotions.</p>
                    <p class="p">For me, the most intriguing question – played in both Star Wars and in real life – is this: What exactly do we mean by “intelligence”?  As we ride the fourth wave of industrial revolution, AI is considered the innovation driver of connected intelligence. But it’s not always clear what the “intelligence” in AI really means. Is artificial intelligence the same as human intelligence? And what is the purpose of the intelligence in AI? What is the role it can and should play for people and businesses in a future world? </p>

                <p class="p">A person’s imagination and creativity are unlimited. We can, in fact, imagine and create an intelligence that propels humanity forward. That’s probably why we created AI, and why AI has evolved so rapidly. AI resembles a certain degree of human intelligence -- the type of smartness for finding, reasoning, predicting, inferencing, and recommending. To do all that, AI manages data at enormous scale and speed. But humanity’s own creation, AI, also inspires mixed reactions about how AI will evolve.</p>
